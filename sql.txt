SQL Injection:
Typical SQL Lookup: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name="[name]";

If you set [name]=" OR 1=1; -- 

SELECT * FROM users WHERE name="" OR 1=1; -- "

-- comments out the rest of the line

Note that SQL lets you use single quotes too, so fiddle with it. If you can break the site with a certain input, you're on the right track
